Created a Student Management System using Python. The system allows you to accept
student details, display them, search for a student, delete student records, and update
student information.
It is built using Python classes and methods, uses lists to store student objects, and
incorporates basic control flow like loops and conditional statements to handle operations
and data management efficiently.
